  # Disable RLS for PayPal Integration

  1. Changes
    - Disable RLS for platform_config table to allow PayPal config access
    - Add policy for wallet_transactions to allow unauthenticated access during PayPal webhook processing
    - Add policy for users table to allow balance updates during PayPal webhook processing

  2. Security Notes
    - platform_config table RLS is disabled since it contains system-wide settings
    - Specific policies are added for PayPal webhook processing
    - Access is still controlled through service role and edge functions
